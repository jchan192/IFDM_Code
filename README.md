This is a Fuzzy Dark Matter simulation code that solves the Schrodinger-Poisson equations based on the Fourier spectral method on a uniform mesh. We adopt the 2nd-order leap-frog scheme for time evolution. To compile the code, MPI and FFTW libraries are required. To perform cosmological simulation, it is required to pre-process the initial condition generated by MUSIC. The code generated results that are presented in the following paper: https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/511/1/943/6505142


# How to run ?

./job.sh 

There are 10 run-time parameters:
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| mfdm      | particle mass of mfdm in eV |
| g         | interaction term in eV cm^3 |
| xmax      | Boxlength / 2 |
| res       | number of grids in 1 axis. Total grid = res**3 |
| t_write   | write output at every t_write step |
| t_stop    | stop at step t_stop |
| ti        | starting step. If rerun = 0, ti = 0. If rerun = 1, ti = preferred snapshot number. |
| opath     | path to output directory. Example: `output/binary/` |
| icpath    | path to input file. Example: `IC/sorted_icN8z50L10.dat` |
| rerun     | 0 if it is a new simulation. 1 if you want to rerun a simulation. |

Example: \
mpirun -n 16 ./BECMPI.o   2.5e-24        0        5.     128    100        1000     0        ${ofile}/binary3/     ${icfile}/sorted_icN8z50L10.dat      0  

Example of reruning a simulation from ti = 1000: \
mpirun -n 16 ./BECMPI.o   2.5e-24        0        5.     128    100        2000     1000        ${ofile}/binary3/     ${ofile}/binary3/                 1


Notes: Reruning a simulation needs to change the icpath to the directory that contains the starting snapshot.

# How to read the outputs?
In the src directory, make readsnap.\
./read res zslice snapnum ifile ofile

There are 5 parameters:
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|res        | number of grids in 1 axis|
|zslice     | the position of the slice along the z-axis |
|snapnum    | the number of the output. Example: output999999.dat has snapnum=999999|
|ifile      | input directory  |
|ofile      | output directory|

Example:\
./readsnap 128 64 999998 output/binary3/ output/slice3/\
It reads a snapshot at output/binary3/output999998.dat and output the slice to output/binary3/output999998.dat.z64

Output file contains 4 columns: \
x [Mpc] y[Mpc] density[solarMass/Mpc**3] phase of wavefunction.
